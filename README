--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple obj 3D file format parser and 3D mesh loader library.

Currently, texture and material both needs to be present in the obj file to be able load
mesh data into the program. See openobj3d.h for mesh definition. The example program shows
how to load an obj file into OpenGL program.

OpenOBJ3D is written in C, but should work with C++ natively.

To install OpenOBJ3D, execute build.sh script in the terminal.

After installing the library to compile your code using gcc just add -limamll in the compile command, e.g: gcc main.c /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openobj3d.so

Enjoy!
